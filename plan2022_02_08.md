# 1. Data of observiation need to write
**include:**
* pipeline of data analyzation,refer to Yu Jie's article:13,000 star of Kepler.
Short-cadence light curves wer stitched together.
a quadratic Savitzky-Golay high-pass filter was applied to remove instrument vriability and low-frequency signals arising from stellar activity.
A 4 $\sigma$-clipping was applied to remove outliers from the high-pass filtered light curves.
* introduction of figure,refer to Jiang chen's article:TESS Asteroseismic Analysis of HD222076

# 2. To Compute Scaling relations
* asfgrid.py of Sharma2016
* solar $\Delta \nu$ use 135.1 uHZ
* run code
